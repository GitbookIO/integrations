    # Overview

    The Mailchimp integration for GitBook provides a way for your readers to subscribe to a Mailchimp Audience.

    # How it works

    After installing the integration and authorizing with your Mailchimp account, a new Mailchimp block will become available in the GitBook editor.
    Insert the Mailchimp block into any page in GitBook to allow users to subscribe directly to your selected Audience.

    # Configure

    Once the Mailchimp block has been inserted, you can configure which Audience you'd like new subscribers to be added to directly on the block. You can also change the call-to-action text to fit the purpose of the mailing list.
