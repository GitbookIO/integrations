    # Overview
    This integration allows you to add the OneTrust cookie consent banner on your published GitBook site.

    # How it works
    The integration injects the OneTrust SDK `otSDKStub.js` on your page, using your Domain Script ID,
    so that the cookie consent banner is displayed and consent is managed according to your OneTrust configuration.

    # Configure
    Install the integration on the GitBook site of your choice.
    Provide your OneTrust Domain Script ID. This required value is provided by OneTrust and corresponds to the data-domain-script attribute in your OneTrust implementation.
