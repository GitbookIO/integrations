    # Overview
    This integration injects the OneTrust SDK to display a cookie consent banner on your GitBook site.

    # How it works
    The integration injects OneTrust's `otSDKStub.js` using your Domain Script ID. The banner will manage consent and load cookies accordingly.

    # Configure
    Install the integration on the GitBook site of your choice and provide your OneTrust Domain Script ID (the value used in `data-domain-script`).
