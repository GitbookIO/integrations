  # Overview

  SalesViewer® is a powerful analytics and visitor identification platform that helps you understand who visits your pages and track their behavior.

  # How it works

  The GitBook SalesViewer® integration allows you to track traffic in your published sites from your SalesViewer® dashboard.

  Each of your connected GitBook sites will fetch the SalesViewer® tracking script and inject it in your public content, enabling visitor tracking and identification.

  # Configure
  Install the integration on the GitBook site of your choice.
  Locate the Account ID you want to use, which is available in SalesViewer® dashboard under "Profile > Project & Tracking code":
