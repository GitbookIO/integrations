  # Overview

  Salesviewer is a powerful analytics and visitor identification platform that helps you understand who visits your pages and track their behavior.

  # How it works

  The GitBook Salesviewer integration allows you to track traffic in your published pages from your Salesviewer dashboard.

  Each of your connected GitBook sites will fetch the Salesviewer tracking script and inject it in your public content, enabling visitor tracking and identification.

  # Configure
  Install the integration on the GitBook space of your choice.
  Locate the Account ID you want to use, which is available in SalesViewer dashboard under "Profile > Project & Tracking code":
