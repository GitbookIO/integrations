    # Overview
    This integration allows to add the PostHog installation snippet on your published GitBook site.

    # How it works
    The integration injects the PostHog script on your page, using the configured project API key and instance address, 
    so that you can get analytics information from your GitBook site directly inside of PostHog.

    # Configure
    Install the integration on the GitBook space of your choice.
    Locate the PostHog project API key and instance address you are using, which is available in PostHog's installation section.
