    # Overview
    This integration allows to add Pendo Analytics on your published GitBook site.

    # How it works
    The integration injects the Pendo Analytics script on your page, using the configured API Key, 
    so that you can get analytics information from your GitBook site directly inside of Pendo.

    # Configure
    Install the integration on the GitBook site of your choice.
    Locate the Pendo API Key you want to use from Pendo and paste it in the GitBook integration's configuration screen
