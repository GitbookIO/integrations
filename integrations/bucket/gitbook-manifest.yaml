    # Overview

    This integration allows you to sync your GitBook site’s schema with feature flags from Bucket in order to bring user data into content allowing you to create adaptive content experiences.

    # How it works

    The integration automatically synchronizes your GitBook site schema with the feature flags defined in Bucket. Any changes made in Bucket will be reflected in your site's schema.

    # Configure

    To configure the integration, you need to connect your GitBook site to your Bucket account by providing your Bucket secret key. Once connected, you can manage your feature flags in Bucket, and they will be automatically reflected in your GitBook site schema.
