    # Overview
    This integration introduces support for collecting analytics on videos played by users. You can explore the full range of analytics offered by Wistia(https://wistia.com/product/analytics).
    The videos are hosted on Wistia and embedded in GitBook using the built-in video embed feature. To enable tracking of these analytics—along with relevant information from the root page—Wistia's JavaScript libraries must be included on the root page.
    This plugin facilitates that by injecting the required Wistia script into the page.

    # How it works
    The integration injects the Wistia script (https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js)
    on your page to enable video analytics tracking.
