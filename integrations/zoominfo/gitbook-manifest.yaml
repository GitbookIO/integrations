    # Overview
    This integration allows to add the ZoomInfo Analytics tracker on your published GitBook site.

    # How it works
    The integration injects the ZoomInfo script on your page, using the script you provide during configuration, 
    so that you can get analytics information from your GitBook site directly inside of ZoomInfo.

    # Configure
    Install the integration on the GitBook site of your choice.
    Locate the ZoomInfo script you want to use, which is available in WebSights management:
     * copy the script and paste it in the GitBook integration's configuration screen
