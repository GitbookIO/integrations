    # Overview
    This integration allows to add the Heap Analytics tracker on your published GitBook site.

    # How it works
    The integration injects the Heap Analytics script on your page, using the configured environment ID, 
    so that you can get analytics information from your GitBook site directly inside of Heap.

    # Configure
    Install the integration on the GitBook space of your choice.
    Locate the Heap environment ID you want to use, which is available in Heap's dashboard under "Account > Install":
     * choose "Install Heap myself", then "Web" and "Code"
     * locate the line showing `heap.load("some ID here")`
     * copy the ID and paste it in the GitBook integration's configuration screen
