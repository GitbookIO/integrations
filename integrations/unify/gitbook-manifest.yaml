    # Overview

    Unify allows you to get a comprehensive understanding of your customers across devices and platforms. The Unify integration for GitBook allows you to track traffic in your published spaces from your Unify dashboard, giving you a fuller picture of how your customer interacts across your sites and apps throughout their lifecycle.

    # How it works

    Automatic tracking in your documentation: Each of your connected GitBook spaces will fetch the Unify tracking script and inject it into your public content.

    # Configure

    GitBook admins can enable the Unify integration by navigating to organization settings. The integration can be enabled on single or multiple spaces available publicly.
