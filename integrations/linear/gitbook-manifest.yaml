    # Overview

    Linear is an issue management software that streamlines issues tracking, sprints, and product roadmaps.

    This integration lets you embed Linear issues into your GitBook documentation. It allows your reader to get a preview of the issues right from your documentation pages.

    # How it works

    Embedding Linear in your documentation is simple - just paste a Linear link into the GitBook editor. The app will turn the link into an embed that show details of the Linear issue like the title, status & assignee along with a snapshot of the issue description.

    # Configure

    Once the Linear integration has been installed, you will have to authorize the connection between GitBook and Linear. You can select specific spaces you which you would like the integration to run on, or select all spaces.
