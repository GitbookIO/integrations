    # Overview

    Sentry helps developers and organizations see what actually matters, solve errors and performance issues quicker, and learn continuously about their application health - from the frontend to the backend.

    This integration lets you embed Sentry issues into your GitBook documentation. It allows your reader to get a preview of the issues right from your documentation pages.

    # How it works

    Embedding Sentry in your documentation is simple - just paste a Sentry issue link (e.g [https://try.sentry-demo.com/organizations/artistic-mudfish/issues/179907/](https://try.sentry-demo.com/organizations/artistic-mudfish/issues/179907/)) into the GitBook editor. The app will turn the link into an embed that show details of the Sentry issue like the title, status & culprit of issue etc.

    # Configure

    You can install Sentry on single space by clicking on the Integrations button or on multiple or all spaces by going into your organization settings. To instal the Sentry integration you will need to authorize the connection between Sentry and GitBook.
