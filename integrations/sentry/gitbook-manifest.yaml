    # Overview

    Sentry helps over developers and organizations see what actually matters, solve errors and performance issues quicker, and learn continuously about their application health - from the frontend to the backend.

    This integration lets you embed Sentry issues into your GitBook documentation. It allows your reader to get a preview of the issues right from your documentation pages.

    # How it works

    Embedding Sentry in your documentation is simple - just paste a Sentry issue link (e.g https://try.sentry-demo.com/organizations/artistic-mudfish/issues/179907/) into the GitBook editor. The app will turn the link into an embed that show details of the Sentry issue like the title, status & culprit of issue etc.
