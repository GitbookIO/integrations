    # Overview

    Sentry helps developers and organizations see what actually matters, solve errors and performance issues quicker, and learn continuously about their application health - from the frontend to the backend.

    This integration lets you embed Sentry issues into your GitBook documentation. It allows your reader to get a preview of the issues right from your documentation pages.

    # How it works

    Embedding Sentry in your documentation is simple - just paste a Sentry issue link (e.g [https://try.sentry-demo.com/organizations/artistic-mudfish/issues/179907/](https://try.sentry-demo.com/organizations/artistic-mudfish/issues/179907/)) into the GitBook editor. The app will turn the link into an embed that show details of the Sentry issue like the title, status & culprit of issue etc.

    # Configure

    You can install Sentry on a single space by clicking on the Integrations button or on multiple or all spaces by going into your organization settings. 

    To complete the installation you will need to provide a API Auth Token. 
    To generate an auth token follow the instructions [here](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/). Choose `event:read` scope and copy-paste the new generated token in the respective configuraiton in GitBook.
