    # Overview
    This integration allows to add the HubSpot tracking code on your published GitBook site.

    # How it works
    The integration injects the HubSpot script on your page, using the configured environment ID, 
    so that you can get analytics information from your GitBook site directly inside of Heap.

    # Configure
    Install the integration on the GitBook space of your choice.
    Locate the HubSpot Script Loader ID you want to use, which is available in HubSpot's Reports & Analytics Tracking section.

    The ID should be just the id - "//js.hs-scripts.com/{hubspot_id}.js". (i.e. only paste what you see in hubspot_id)
