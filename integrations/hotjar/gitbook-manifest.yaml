    # Overview
    This integration allows to add the Hotjar tracker on your published GitBook site.

    # How it works
    The integration injects the Hotjar Analytics script on your page, using the configured environment ID, 
    so that you can get analytics information from your GitBook site directly inside of Heap.

    # Configure
    Install the integration on the GitBook space of your choice.
    Locate the Hotjar site ID you want to use, which is available in Hotjar's Organization & sites section
