    # Overview

    The GitHub Unfurl integration allows you to take a link to a GitHub file, or permalinks to lines of code in a GitHub file and unfurl them into code blocks in GitBook.

    # How it works

    After installing the GitHub Unfurl integration, you're able to insert it into a GitBook file in the (CMD + /) menu.

    Insert the integration, paste your link, and the integration will display the code in a formatted code block.

    # Configure

    In order to unfurl code from private repositories, you'll need to authorize with your GitHub Account in the integration's configuration page.
