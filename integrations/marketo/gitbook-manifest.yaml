    # Overview

    Marketo Engage is a complete AI-powered marketing automation platform, and part of the Adobe Experience Cloud. This integration provides support for Marketo forms and the Munchkin tracking script.

    # How it works

    This integration allows you to connect the Munchkin tracking script to your GitBook docs site, and embed Marketo forms in your content.

    # Configure

    You can enable the integration on single published space by navigating to the sub-navigation and clicking on Integrations button. If you prefer to enable the integration or multiple or all published spaces you can do so by navigating to the org settings and clicking the Integrations tab. You will need your Domain to finish the configuration.
