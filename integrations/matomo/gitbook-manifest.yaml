    # Overview

    Matomo (formerly Piwik) is a powerful open‑source web analytics platform. This integration lets you track visits to your published GitBook spaces directly in your Matomo instance (cloud or self‑hosted).

    # How it works

    The integration injects a lightweight tracking script that respects GitBook's cookie consent. When consent is granted, it sends pageview events to your configured Matomo server using the Matomo Tracking API. Single‑page navigation within GitBook is tracked automatically.

    # Configure

    Install the integration on the GitBook space(s) you want to track, then provide your Matomo server URL and Site ID.
