    # Overview
    This integration allows to add the Mixpanel tracker on your published GitBook site.

    # How it works
    The integration injects the Mixpanel script on your page, using the configured project token, 
    so that you can get analytics information from your GitBook site directly inside of Mixpanel.

    # Configure
    Install the integration on the GitBook space of your choice.
    Locate the Mixpanel Project Token you want to use, which is available in Mixpanel's Project Settings section
