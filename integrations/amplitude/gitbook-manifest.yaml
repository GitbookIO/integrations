    # Overview

    Amplitude is a powerful analytics and visitor identification platform that helps you understand who visits your pages and track their behavior.

    # How it works

    The GitBook Amplitude integration allows you to track traffic in your published sites from your Amplitude dashboard.

    Each of your connected GitBook sites will fetch the Amplitude tracking script and inject it in your public content, enabling visitor tracking and identification.

    # Configure
    Install the integration on the GitBook site of your choice.

    Locate the API Key you want to use, which is available in Amplitude dashboard under "Organization Settings > Projects":
