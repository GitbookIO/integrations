        Bring the power of GitBook to your Slack workspace with our AI-powered integration. Now your teams have instant access to all the knowledge in your GitBook org, right in Slack.

        *Search made simple:*

        Getting answers has never been easier. Just type /gitbook [question] or invite the GitBook bot to your channel, and our AI will scan your knowledge base and give you a summarized answer in seconds.

        *Get notified about the important stuff:*

        You’ll get a ping when something important happens to your GitBook content. And you choose what’s important — such as when your content is updated or published — so you only get the notifications you need.

        *Improved link-sharing:*

        The GitBook integration automatically generates a nifty preview for any GitBook links you share in Slack.
