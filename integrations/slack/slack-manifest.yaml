        The GitBook Slack integration brings the power of GitBook to your Slack workspace. Your teams have instant access to your GitBook knowledge base, without leaving Slack.

        *Get notified of what's important:*

        Receive real-time Slack notifications when something important happens to your content on GitBook. For example, when your content is updated, published, etc.

        Pick and choose what, where, and how you wish to be notified.

        *Searching made simple:*

        Searching has never been easier. Use Slack global shortcuts to search within your content: Type "/gitbook [search]".

        *Improved links sharing:*

        The GitBook Slack integration will automatically generate a nice-looking preview for all GitBook links shared in Slack.
