description: Embed interactive Node.js notebooks in your GitBook documentation.
summary: |
    # Overview

    RunKit notebooks are interactive JavaScript playgrounds connected to a complete Node environment right in your browser. Every npm module pre-installed.

    They make it easy for your users to run sample code right from your documentation.

    # How it works

    The integration allows you to embed live examples into your GitBook, removing the friction of trying new ideas. You can bring your code to life by allowing your users to run the sample of your code within your documentation.

    Adding RunKit notebooks in your documentation is simple - select the RunKit block from the [command palette](https://gitbook.com/docs/tour/editor/blocks#command-palette) and insert your code snippet.
    Or paste the link to an existing RunKit notebook into the GitBook editor to embed it in your page.

    # Configure

    Click Integrations button in sub-navigation to install the RunKit in a single space, alternatively navigate to your organization settings to install it on multiple or all spaces.
