summary: |
    # Overview

    RunKit notebooks are interactive JavaScript playgrounds connected to a complete Node environment right in your browser. Every npm module pre-installed.

    They make it easy for your users to run sample code right from your documentation.

    # How it works

    Adding RunKit notebooks in your documentation is simple - select the RunKit block from the [Command palette](https://docs.gitbook.com/tour/editor/blocks#command-palette) and insert your code snippet.

    Or paste the link to an existing RunKit notebook into the GitBook editor to embed it in your page.
