    # Overview

    By connecting Intercom to GitBook, you turn every resolved ticket into a source of documentation intelligence. The integration continuously ingests conversation data, detects recurring issues, and identifies where your docs can be clearer, more accurate, or more complete.

    ## How it works

    GitBook's Docs Agent analyzes the conversation data, detects recurring issues, and identifies where your docs can be clearer, more accurate, or more complete. It then opens proactive change requests based on this insight—suggesting edits, drafting improvements, and helping you keep content fresh as your product evolves. You can also @mention the AI agent or chat with it directly to accelerate reviews and edits inside any change request.

    ## Configure

    1. Authorize GitBook to access Intercom
        After installing the app in Intercom, make sure you install the GitBook integration in your GitBook account to continue set up. After installing the GitBook integration, open the integration settings and click Connect Account. This enables GitBook to pull closed tickets and their full conversation history while automatically stripping sensitive data.

    2. Select what customer conversations to use as context
        Choose the inboxes, tags, or teams that best represent the voice of your customers.
        GitBook uses these conversations to understand issues, trends, and documentation gaps.

    3. Let the Docs Agent learn from your tickets
        Behind the scenes, GitBook classifies and analyzes each conversation to identify:
            - Frequently asked questions
            - Outdated or unclear documentation
            - Missing troubleshooting steps
            - Opportunities to improve explanations
    4. Watch GitBook open proactive change requests
        Once patterns emerge, GitBook will automatically open change requests with suggested content updates.
        Each change request includes:
            - A proposed doc edit or improvement
            - Conversation context explaining why
            - A working draft written by the AI agent
    5. Use the AI agent to refine and finalize
        Inside any change request, @mention the GitBook agent or open its chat panel to request rewrites, edits, clarifications, or additions.
        You stay in control while the agent accelerates the entire documentation update cycle.
