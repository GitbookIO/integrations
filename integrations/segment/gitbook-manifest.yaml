    # Overview

    The GitBook Segment integration empowers your teams by connecting your GitBook public documentation to your Segment pipeline.

    # How it works

    Automatic page view events on your public documentation:
    Each of your connected GitBook sites will send a `[GitBook] site_view` event to the associated Segment source.

    Track your users' actions across all your company's websites:
    - Each `[GitBook] site_view` includes the `anonymousId` property.
    - If the active user has already visited one of your other company's websites, the `anonymousId` will match the one already set by Segment.
    - Otherwise, GitBook will associate a new `anonymousId` for the user matching Segment's format.

    # Configure

    In Segment, you can set up a source to receive the GitBook events. After adding an HTTP API source in Segment, you will see a Write Key. This key is used to identify the data source in GitBook.

    If you are [**located in the EU**](https://segment.com/docs/guides/eu-region/), you may need to configure an optional parameter to track events successfully. Additionally, you will need to [use an EU Write Key](https://segment.com/docs/guides/regional-segment/#custom-http-requests).

    To install the Segment integration on a single space click on the Integrations button in sub-navigation. Alternatively, you can install it on multiple or all spaces by going into your organization settings. You will need the Segment Write Key to help you identify the data source.
