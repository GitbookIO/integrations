summary: |
    The GitBook Segment integration connects your public documentation on GitBook to your Segment pipeline, empowering your teams.

    Automatic page view events on your public documentation:
    Each of your connected GitBook spaces will send a `[GitBook] space_view` event to the associated Segment source.

    Track your users' actions across all your company's websites:
    Each `[GitBook] space_view` includes the `anonymousId` property.
    If the active user has already visited one of your other company's websites, the `anonymousId` will match the one already set by Segment.
    Otherwise, GitBook will associate a new `anonymousId` for the user matching Segment's format.
