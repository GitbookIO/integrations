    # Overview

    The GitBook Segment integration empowers your teams by connecting your GitBook public documentation to your Segment pipeline.

    # How it works

    Automatic page view events on your public documentation:
    Each of your connected GitBook spaces will send a `[GitBook] space_view` event to the associated Segment source.

    Track your users' actions across all your company's websites:
    - Each `[GitBook] space_view` includes the `anonymousId` property.
    - If the active user has already visited one of your other company's websites, the `anonymousId` will match the one already set by Segment.
    - Otherwise, GitBook will associate a new `anonymousId` for the user matching Segment's format.

    # Configure

    To install the Segment integration on a single space click on the Integrations button in sub-navigation. Alternatively, you can install it on multiple or all spaces by going into your organization settings. You will need the Segment Write Key to help you identify the data source.
