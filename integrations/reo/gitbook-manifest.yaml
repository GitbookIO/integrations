    # Overview
    Reo.Dev is the Business to Developer (B2D) ABM platform that helps you find revenue opportunity from developer activity.
    This integration lets you add the Reo.Dev Javascript on your published GitBook site to seamlessly analyze developer intent through any interactions with your content on GitBook.

    # How it works
    The integration injects the Reodotdev script on your page, using the configured client ID, 
    so that you can get analytics information from your GitBook site directly inside of Reo.

    # Configure
    Install the integration on the GitBook space of your choice.
    Locate the Reodotdev's client ID you want to use, which is available in Reodotdev's Integration -> Documentation section
