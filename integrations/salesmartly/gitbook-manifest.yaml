    # Overview

    The Salesmartly integration for GitBook allows you to display the Salesmartly chat widget on your public documentation to connect and interact with your readers.

    # How it works

    Automatic chat widget on your documentation: Each of your connected GitBook spaces will fetch the Salesmartly chat widget script and inject it in your published content.

    # Configure

    You can configure the integration on single or multiple public spaces by navigating to the integrations in sub-navigation or org settings. You will then have to provide Application ID to finish the configuration.
