    # Overview
    The Webhook integration allows you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your GitBook spaces. Configure webhook URLs to receive events like page views, content updates, and user feedback.

    # How it works
    **Real-time notifications:** Get notified instantly when important events happen in your GitBook spaces.

    **Flexible event selection:** Choose which events you want to receive - from page views to content updates.

    **Secure delivery:** Optional HMAC signature verification ensures webhook authenticity.

    **Reliable delivery:** Built-in retry logic ensures your webhooks are delivered even during temporary network issues.

    # Configure

    # Webhook Payload
    Each webhook request includes:
    - Event type and data
    - Timestamp
    - Installation information
    - Optional HMAC signature for verification
