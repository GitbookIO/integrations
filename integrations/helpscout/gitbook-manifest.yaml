    # Overview

    The HelpScout integration for GitBook allows you to display the HelpScout chat widget on your public documentation to connect and interact with your readers.

    # How it works

    Automatic chat widget on your documentation: Each of your connected GitBook spaces will fetch the HelpScout chat widget script and add it to your published content.

    # Configure

    You can configure the integration on single or multiple public spaces by navigating to the integrations in sub-navigation or org settings. You will then have to provide HelpScout ID to finish the configuration.
