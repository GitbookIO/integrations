    # Overview
    The GitLab Unfurl integration allows you to take a link to a GitLab file, or permalink to lines of code in a GitLab file and unfurl them into code blocks in GitBook.

    # How it works
    After installing the GitLab Unfurl integration, you're able to insert it into a GitBook file in the (CMD + /) menu.
    Insert the integration, paste your link, and the integration will display the code in a formatted code block.

    # Configure
    In order to unfurl code from private repositories, you'll need to authorize with your GitLab Account in the integration's configuration page.
