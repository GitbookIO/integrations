    # Overview

    The GitLab Files integration allows you to take a link to a GitLab file or a permalink to lines of code and display them into code blocks in GitBook.

    # How it works

    After installing the GitLab Files integration, you're able to insert it into a GitBook file in the (CMD + /) menu.

    Insert the integration, paste your link, and the integration will display the code in a formatted code block.

    # Configure

    In order to view code from private repositories, you'll need to authorize with your GitLab Account in the integration's configuration page.
