    # Overview
    [Ahrefs Web Analytics](https://ahrefs.com/web-analytics) is a privacy-friendly analytics platform that provides you with a simple and free solution to track and report your published spaces' traffic.  No cookies by default.  Just the metrics you need.

    # How it works
    The Ahrefs integration allows you to track traffic in your published spaces from your Ahrefs dashboard.

    Automatic tracking in your documentation: Each of your connected GitBook spaces will fetch the Ahrefs Web Analytics tracking script and inject it in your public content.

    # Configure
    Enable the Ahrefs integration by navigating to organization settings.  The integration can be enabled on single or multiple spaces available publicly.
