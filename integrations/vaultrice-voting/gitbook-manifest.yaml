    # Overview

    The Vaultrice Voting Integration allows you to embed interactive voting widgets directly into your GitBook pages. Users can vote on options and see real-time results without requiring any backend infrastructure.

    # Features

    - **Real-time voting**: Vote counts update instantly across all clients
    - **No backend required**: Powered by Vaultrice's encrypted key-value storage
    - **Persistent results**: Vote data is stored securely and persists across sessions
    - **Customizable**: Configure titles, descriptions, and voting options

    # How it works

    Once installed, you can insert voting widgets into any page. Configure the voting options, title, and description through the block editor. Results are displayed in real-time as users vote.
