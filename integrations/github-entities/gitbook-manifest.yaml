    # Overview

    The GitHub Entities integration for GitBook lets you synchronize repositories with GitBook and add important workflow information to your team’s knowledge base.

    # How it works

    Once you’ve set it up, the integration will sync your GitHub issues, pull requests, releases, comments and general metadata with GitBook. So when you ask GitBook AI a question about your latest PRs, or ask it to list the five latest issues, it can answer and link you to the relevant place.

    # Configure

    In order to sync entities from private repositories, you’ll need to authorize with your GitHub account in the integration’s configuration page.
