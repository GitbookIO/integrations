    # Overview
    Authenticated access allows you to publish content behind an authentication wall, so your content is only accessible to people you choose.

    This integration lets you control access to your published content as determined by Okta.

    # Configure
    Install this integration on a space and then populate the configuration screen with the details of your Okta application and Okta instance.
    You can then open the Share menu, publish the space with authenticated access, choose this integration as the authentication backend, and hit Save.

    Your space is now published with authenticated access using Okta.
