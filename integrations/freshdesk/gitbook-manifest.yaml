    # Overview

    The Freshdesk integration for GitBook allows you to display the Freshdesk chat widget on your public documentation to connect and interact with your readers.

    # How it works

    Automatic chat widget on your documentation: Each of your connected GitBook sites will fetch the Freshdesk chat widget script and inject it in your published content.

    # Configure

    You can configure the integration on single or multiple public sites by navigating to the integrations in sub-navigation or org settings. You will then have to provide Freshdesk widget ID to finish the configuration. This can be found in your Freshdesk dashboard, under the Widget section.
