    # Overview

    The GitHub Files integration allows you to take a link to a GitHub file or a permalink to lines of code and display them into code blocks in GitBook. It also supports snippet tags for extracting specific code sections.

    # How it works

    After installing the GitHub Files integration, you're able to insert it into a GitBook file in the (CMD + /) menu.

    **GitHub Files**: Insert the integration, paste your link, and the integration will display the code in a formatted code block.

    **GitHub Snippet**: Insert the snippet block, provide a GitHub URL and a snippet tag (e.g., "BaseOAuthExample"), and the integration will extract and display only the code between the `--8<-- [start:tag]` and `--8<-- [end:tag]` markers. You can also add multiple snippets to combine them into a single code block.

    **Simple GitHub Reference**: Insert the simple GitHub block and provide repository details (owner, repo, branch, file path) for an easier way to reference files without full URLs.

    # Configure

    In order to view code from private repositories, you'll need to authorize with your GitHub Account in the integration's configuration page.
