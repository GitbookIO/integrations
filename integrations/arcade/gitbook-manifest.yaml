summary: |
    # Overview

    Arcade lets you create interactive product demos in minutes and turn all users into power users. Let users experience your product through interactive, guided demos. No more pausing and rewinding, users can progress at their own pace.

    This integration allow you to embed Arcade interactive demos into your GitBook documentation.

    # How it works

    Embedding an Arcade flow in your documentation is simple - just paste an Arcade flow link into the GitBook editor. The app will turn the link into an Arcade embed showing your recorded demo.

    # Configure

    To install on a single space navigate to integrations in sub-navigation. If you prefer to install the Arcade integration on multiple or all spaces, navigate to your organization settings and enable it from the integrations panel. This will give you access to the custom arcade block.
