    # Overview

    Fathom Analytics is a no cookie analytics platform which you can enable with a single line of code. Gain valuable insights into your website or web application while being GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy, PECR (and more) compliant.

    # How it works

    The GitBook Fathom Analytics integration allows you to track traffic in your published spaces from your Fathom dashboard.

    Automatic tracking in your documentation: Each of your connected GitBook spaces will fetch the light-weight Fathom tracking script and inject it in your public content.

    # Configure

    Analytics integrations can be configured only for spaces that are published. To enable the integration in a single space, click on Integrations button in the sub-navigation. Alternatively you can enable it for multiple or all published spaces by going into your organization settings. You will need your Site ID to finish the configuration.
