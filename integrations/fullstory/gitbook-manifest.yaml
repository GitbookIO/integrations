    # Overview

    Fullstory is a digital experience analytics platform that helps companies understand how users interact with their websites and apps. The Fullstory integration for GitBook allows you to gather analytics in Fullstory from visitors to your docs site.

    # How it works

    AI-powered insights from your documentation: Each of your connected GitBook sites will fetch the Fullstory tracking script and inject it into your public content.

    # Configure

    GitBook admins can enable the Fullstory integration by navigating to organization settings. The integration can be enabled on a per-site basis or for all sites in the organization.
