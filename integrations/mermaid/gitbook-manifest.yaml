    # Overview

    Mermaid lets you create diagrams and visualizations using text and code. If you are familiar with Markdown you should have no problem learning [Mermaid's Syntax](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/./n00b-syntaxReference).

    # How it works

    Once the integration is installed, insert the Mermaid block into any page. You can edit the code content and preview how it looks using the live editor.

    When using the GitHub or GitLab integrations, all code blocks with the mermaid syntax will be replaced by diagram. All diagrams inserted from the editor will be formatted as such code blocks in Markdown.

    # Configure

    You can install the integration on the single space by clicking on the Integrations button in the sub-space navigation, or on multiple spaces by navigating to the organization settings.
