summary: |
    The Statuspage integration for GitBook allows you to display your status page directly in your published content.

    # Display the status of your site in GitBook
    GitBook will display the up-to-date status information of the page linked to this integration in a block on your
    published content. Just insert the block wherever you want the status to display and we'll take care of the rest.

    # Subscribe and unsubscribe to status changes
    Users accessing your published content on GitBook will be able to use the custom Statuspage block to subscribe to
    status changes, like they would in your official status page.
