# Introduction

GitBook’s developer platform allows you to build integrations that seamlessly connect GitBook to internal tools, third‑party services, custom workflows and more.

You can use the integration platform to:

* **Automate repetitive tasks:** Sync content, manage permissions, or trigger actions without leaving GitBook.
* **Embed interactive components:** Enhance documentation pages with custom built UI, buttons, and dynamic content.
* **Integrate data from other tools**: Pull in data from external sources and connect them with your GitBook workflow.
* **Securely connect systems:** Handle authentication via OAuth and manage access control programmatically.

…and much more, all via GitBook’s developer SDK.
