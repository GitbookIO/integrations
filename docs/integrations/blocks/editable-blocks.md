# Editable blocks

Some blocks might be static or only generated from [link unfurling](link-unfurling.md), but most blocks are designed to be editable by the user. Editable means that the user can interact with the blocks to change its properties.

Updating the properties of a block is done through a [`@editor.node.updateProps` action](../contentkit/reference.md#editor.node.updateprops):

```typescript
<block>
    <textinput state="content" />
    <button
        label="Edit"
        onPress={{
            action: '@editor.node.updateProps',
            props: {
                content: element.dynamicState('content')
            }
        }}
        />
</block>
```
