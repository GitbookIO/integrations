# Overview

When using GitBook, you're able to search through a [library of public integrations](https://www.gitbook.com/integrations) you can use to enhance the sites and projects you're working on.

You're able to access any public integration from our [website](https://www.gitbook.com/integrations), or directly [in the app](http://app.gitbook.com/integrations/) when writing a new page.

GitBook's marketplace contains integrations built or verified by GitBook. In order to add your app, you'll need to go through our [app submission process](submit-your-app-for-review.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
You can still share an integration you build in GitBook with others, without it publicly being listed in GitBook's marketplace.&#x20;

See the [publishing section](../getting-started/publishing.md) to learn more.
{% endhint %}

If youâ€™re interested in seeing a specific integration in GitBook, [let us know in our community](https://github.com/GitbookIO/community).
