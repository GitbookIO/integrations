### Docs
The official developer docs for GitBook, hosted on https://developer.gitbook.com/. Our documentation uses one of GitBook's most useful features-[Git Sync](https://gitbook.com/docs/product-tour/git-sync)!

Git Sync allows you to keep your GitBook site up to date with a remote repository either on GitHub or GitLab. In our case we have the [/docs](../docs/) directory synced with https://developer.gitbook.com/. This means that any changes reviewed, approved, and merged into this directory will automatically be deployed!

### Integrations
The integrations found in this repository are owned and maintained by the GitBook organization. If you're interested in creating your own integration - you can! Head to our [getting started guide](https://developer.gitbook.com/getting-started/setup-guide) to build your first integration.

If you're interested in contributing to any of our already published integrations that live in [/integrations](../integrations/), you're more than welcome to add or update any changes you think would make our integrations better. Every contribution will be reviewed and tested by our team.

### Packages
You're also welcome to contribute updates or improvements to the packages living in [/packages](../packages/). Head to each package's documentation page to learn more about what each one does.
